NetHack::FOV 0.01

NetHack::FOV is a field-of-view implementation that is bug-compatible
with NetHack.  That is, you give it a map and a viewpoint, and it tells
you which locations you could see on said map if you were standing at
the viewpoint in a game of NetHack.  It's expected to be useful for
people who need to second-guess the NetHack view algorithm, such as
bot writers.

If you are writing a game of your own, you don't want this module,
unless you want to copy all of NetHack's view bugs.
